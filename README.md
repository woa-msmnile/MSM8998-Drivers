# Windows Driver pack for MSM8998 Devices based on [SurfaceDuo-Drivers](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Drivers/)

* These driver files are not perfect, typos may exist, feel free to file an issue on GitHub in case you found any.
## Tip
* By installing this driver pack, you agree that any damage done to your phone or any loss of data is your entire responsibility and we cannot be taken responsible for data loss if it ever happens. We believe however this driver pack is safe to install. Try at your own risk!
* Charging an extra fee for a phone where you would have installed those drivers and you are selling online or to users is immoral and illegal due to where those drivers come from. An end user may not know how to update their system in the future and will most likely spent a lot more than what it should have for a driver pack he can find for free online. Selling a device with an extra fee also ruins the work of others that worked on this project. While we can't enforce this policy, we decided to put this notice here in the hopes of some people understanding the morality of this
